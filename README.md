# NSpire Clock

This is a clock for the TI-NSpire calcs. Works on both the CX and grey calculators (must be Ndless 3.1 though).

It displays the current time and date. That is all.

## How to use

The program will prompt you if you need to set the time. Otherwise, as long as you don't let your calculator hibernate or hit the reset button, the RTC will retain the current time and you won't need to constantly set it.

```Ctrl+Shift```: Set the time
```Ctrl+Enter```: Snaps to nearest minute (dodgy)
```Ctrl+Var```: Set to Black on White background
```Ctrl+Del```: Set to White on Black background
```Ctrl+Plus and Ctrl+Minus```: Control the contrast/brightness
```Esc```: Exit
